 # 1. Description of the F1 application
 
The visualizations are aimed at giving insight how rule changes, also called formulas, have an effect on team dominance. Consensus exists among F1 fans that team dominance rarely survives a significant rule change. This application empowers the user to find out wether this is true or not.
 
 # 2. Technical design
 
## &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1 High level overview

#### 1. Python
Python handles the data structure which is used by JavaScript to generate visualizations.

#### 2. JavaScript
JavaScript handles the actual initiations and updates of the visualizations. F1.js follows a linear flow, from map initiation to pie chart drawing and updating. After the data has been loaded in a queue, a main function is called. This main function handles all logic for drawing the map. The rest of the visualizations are cascades from the map init function, and initialised and updated with on clicks of relevant elements of another visualization. The general flow of F1.js is as follows:

1. Load DOM
2. Load Data
3. Map init
    * marker on click function defined
      * init line graph
4. Line graph init
    * Line graph update function defined
    * overlay on click function defined
      * init pie chart
5. Pie chart init
    * pie chart update function defined
      * overlay on click updated to update pie chart

Functions relevant to each part, e.g. map color gradients and functions that get indices from the overlay of the line graph are explained in detail in **section 2.2.3**.

## &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2 Low level overview

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.1 Data
 
There are several datasets generated by request.py. This file uses GET request to an API, Ergast, to fetch, format and store data in .json files. After fetching and processing the data, the following data sets are generated with the following purposes:

1. choro.json
    * Initiate and update the dataMaps colors and values per country
2. markers.json
    * Drawing markers on the dataMap
    * Information to show in dataMap popup
3. laptimes.json
    * Drawing the line graph with laptimes per season
4. winners.json
    * Drawing and updating the pie chart with constructor wins per season
5. rules.json
    * Updating the rule tables next to the line graph

 ### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.3 Functions (F1.js)

```javascript
function drawmap() {};
```
This function initiates the map and all map functionality. It calls the following notable functions:
1. gradientBuilder()
2. mapDataBuilder()
3. drawMarkers()
4. buildLineChart()
5. zoom()
6. center()
7. showHideMarkers()
8. slideUpdateMap()
9. buildLegend()

```javascript
function gradientBuilder() {};
```
Called from **drawMap();**, this functions builds a semi linear color scale. The colors are coupled to an int, the smallest value is given a non linear color. Any color after that is scaled according to a linear scale. This scale is used in **mapDataBuilder();** to build an object wich is recognised by datamaps and can be used in the dataMaps method **updateChoropleth();** to update the map colors. These colors now correspond to int values on the map. This method is coupled to a user controlled slider.

One drawback is that it takes more work to implement this kind of scale than a simple d3 linear scale. However, one advantage is that there is no need for an extra check in the **mapDataBuilder();** function to check for the smallest non linear value, and the color coupled to it. This check would need to be done on every update of the slider, while **gradientBuilder();** is only initialised once and passes the function to a different variable that can be called at will.

The color scale also bundels all value: color 'keys' in one function. This is more logical than a linear scale plus an extra check somewhere else in the code.

Moreover, this color scale can easily be altered for any kind of int data, making the map more flexible for later updates and datasets. The predefined argument is already included for easy updates of scales.

```javascript
function mapDataBuilder() {};
```
Called from **drawMap();** to init map colors of countries with an F1 GP in 1950. It is subsequently called from **slideUpdateMap();** to update the map colors after user input from the season slider. It builds a dictionary used by the **updatechoropleth();** method to color countries according to data values, a number of races in this case.

```javascript
function slideUpdateMap() {};
```
Called from an anonymous function within the done* parameter of the dataMap in the **drawMap();** function to ensure the map elements are ready for slide updates.

It uses a slider input element to select a season. Calling **mapDataBuilder();** it builds a dictionary with color values and race values for the selected season. Used by the **updatechoropleth();** method to update the dataMaps country colors.

```javascript
function drawMarkers() {};
```
Called from an anonymous function within the done* parameter of the dataMap in the **drawMap();** function to ensure the map bubbles method is ready. This function draws the markers on the map using the bubbles method and adds a popup displaying the circuit name.

A strange 'feature' of dataMaps is that the radius parameter must be passed to the map.bubbles() dataMaps method, but the radius of the markers must also be initialised with a d3 selection. This is some extra work, but the d3 marker selection is needed later anyways for zooming and translating the bubbles across the map.

The function returns the marker selection and also the radius for later use to reduce redundent d3 selections. The selection is used by **zoom();** and **center();** to correctly reposition the markers after the user pans, zooms or centers the map on a country.

```javascript
function zoom() {};
```
Called from an anonymous function within the done* parameter of the dataMap in the **drawMap();** function to ensure the projection method is ready.

It ensures proper mouse click panning and scroll zooming on the map using the map projection.

```javascript
function center() {};
```
Called from the same place as **zoom();** for the same reason, it ensures proper mouse country click panning on the map. 

```javascript
function showHideMarkers() {};
```
Called from an anonymous function within the done* parameter of the dataMap in the **drawMap();** function to ensure the markers have been drawn.

Groups logic for showing and hiding markers. The display styles are used to make markers non clickable, as making the r attribute equal to 0 still enabled an on click and the mouseover tooltip. Transitions and delays are grouped for ease of use and updating the function. The delay ensures a proper hide animation.

```javascript
function buildLegend() {};
```
Called from the **drawMap();** function.

Builds a configurable legend bar for the dataMap. Adds mouse hover selection functionality, a d3-tip and calls the **borderChange();** function which changes the border thickness of selected countries. All the functionality is based on the amount of F1 races in a country. A user can select an amount via the legend by hovering over it with the mouse. The amount of races selected via the legend is calculated by the **getLegendValue();** function. This value is used by the tip to give the user feedback on the selected amount, and the **borderChange()** function to actually change the borderthickness of the countries with a race amount corresponding to the selected amount.

```javascript
function borderChange() {};
```
Called from the **buildLegend();** function.

Using an integer value and all country isos which will host at least one GP, it selects all countries where the race amount is equal to the integer value. Then it increases the border thickness, otherwhise border thickness is reset.

```javascript
function updateLineGraph() {};
```
Called from an anonymous function within the done* parameter of the dataMap in the **drawMap();** function to ensure the markers have been drawn.

First it draws empty axes by processing empty time and date domains with empty tick formats. It also adds an empty line and focus elements. 

These include:
1. The two focus lines
  * An x-line
  * A y-line
2. The focus circle
3. The focus overlay

These are grouped in a <g> element which is hidden with a, display: none, style. The result are two empty axes, signalling to the user that these can be filled with data after an input. The empty elements are created to be updates easily later with the **updateLineGraph();** function.

```javascript
function getTrueData() {};
```
When the user wants to select a season from the line chart, this is the function that handles it. First it uses the invert method of the xScale function. This means translating a mouse coordinate to a date string, essentially the reverse process of getting drawing x-axis ticks. Then it bisects this date string into the dataset, returning the index where the date should be stored if inserted into a date sorted data set. Using the index, the trailing and leading datasets are used to find the one closest to the mouse location.

```javascript
function updateTitle() {};
```
Updates title html elements after the user selects a circuit from the map, or a season from the line graph. The class is passed as a string, as is the text the title is to be updated with. The class is used to select the correct element(s) and the text is used to update the element's html.

# Challenges & changes

## Python data gen
The focus was not on efficiency, as the data only needs updating once a year.

## Table update and data structure
A challenge was finding a logical way to update a table to the most recent ruleset. The most difficult part was finding a simple way to do 1 of two things:
1. Find a simple way to fill a data object with mostly the same data for all seasons
2. Find a way to revert back to the most recent change of a rule subset (like the engine size or fuel limit)

As the information is not readily available and has to be filled in by hand in excel, the choice was to go for the second option. This saves time updating the information and decreases the amount of duplicate info in the rules dataset. The trade-off is that more work has to be done at the back end to find the most recent ruleset. 

This is implemented by mostly filling the dataset with empty strings, and bisecting a list of all seasons where the rules have changed. If the user selected a season where the rules have not changed, the bisected index is used to find the most recent season where the rules have changed. The rules are keys and the text are the values, key by key a check is made is the text value is not empty. If it is, the index is decreased to an even earlier season where the rules have changed unil the most recent rulechange for the key is found.

## Pie chart update
Another challenge was the pie chart update. It turns out the slices are not, locked, to each label. If an update is made, the order of the labels in the dataset and the order of the slices determine which slice gets which data value. This means if the first slice represents Ferrari, and Mercedes is in the 0th index of the new dataset, the Ferrari slice updates with the mercedes win amount. The ideal update would of be to exit the Ferrari slice and enter the mercedes slice. 

However, due to time constraints and other important focus points, a simple fix was chosen. The dataset now includes all possible winners in alphabetical order (total of 44) at all times. Win values are 0 if slices need to be 'exited'. This creates consistency in the pie chart update, but is not ideal as there should be no need to keep empty datasets around.
