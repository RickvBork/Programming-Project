# Problem statement

The FIA, the governing body of many automitive sports, have prediodically tried to decrease the speed of the cars from 1994 onwards. However, 
Formula 1 (F1) teams continue to find clever solutions to keep laptimes low to maintain a competitive edge. F1 is currently enjoying an 
injection of new fans after a successfull Social Media strategy. These new fans might benefit from visualizations of what perhaps is the most 
technical and most difficult to follow sport on earth. Currently good visualizations are lacking on the F1 site, this creates a gap to be filled.
